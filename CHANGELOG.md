5.7.4
 - Fixed a bug that caused video & interstitial ads that failed to load once, sending the adFailedToLoad callback event, start always sending adAlreadyLoaded on subsequent failed loads

5.7.3 
 - Added a new ad callback event called adEmpty. This will be forwarded when the ad server returns successfully (status code 200) but has no actual ad to serve.
 - Added this event to the AIR and Unity plugins
 - It is also handled by the AdMob/MoPub adapters in their own internal logic
 - Updated the way the Unity plugin displays banners in reaction to changes in Unity v5.6.x. Now all banners are displayed in as a subview of custom dialogs, above the main activity.

 - Added camel & snake case options when parsing the SACreative object - for click, impression and install
 - Added the osTarget parameter to the SACreative
 - Added more error checks to SAEvents
 - Fixed bugs in SAVideoAd, SAInterstitialAd & SAAppWall when trying to play an ad that's not yet been properly loaded
 - The SAJsonParser library can now create JSON objects & arrays by giving a variable number of arguments instead of an array of arguments
 - Fixed tests

5.5.6
 - Updated the Model space SADetails class to have a "base" string member to hold the base Url of the creative
 - Updated the Web Player to work with a base url and eliminate a series of minor bugs where 3rd party tags weren't rendered correctly
 - Added a guard in the Web Player to not call the layout observer on a null container 

5.5.3
 - Added support for scrollable interstitials

5.5.2
 - Refactored the SAModelSpace library to:
    - remove all Ad Events from the SACreative object
    - add a SAVASTAdType object to SAMedia; for video ads this is where additional details will be stored from now on 
    - renamed the SATracking model to SAVASTEvent
    - added an integer to the SAAd model that holds the configuration (PRODUCTION / STAGING)
    - the ad itself is now responsbile for creating the SAReferral model (since it stores configuration)
    - added a new constructor for SAAd that takes placementId, configuration and JSON string
 - Updated the VAST Parser library to take into account the new modelspace; added more tests
 - Updated the SAAdLoader library:
    - to take into account the new modelspace
    - to not try to add events to the SAAd class; 
    - added more tests
 - Refactored the SAEvents library:
    - each type of event (VAST events, click through, impression, etc) is now a separate class; that makes it easier to test 
    - there are now for modules: VASTModule, ServerModule, ViewableModule and MoatModule that deal with these different things that need to be triggered
    - added a lot more tests
 - Updated the CPI library to work with the new modelspace
 - Updated the Main SDK to work with the new modelspace & eventing system

5.5.1
 - Minor update to rename some internal SAAd object members to have shorter names

5.5.0
 - Refactored click handling to now ignore null click urls
    - ads that now have a null click url won't fire either the parental gate or any associated click urls (for video, for example). 
    - refactored the web processror (SAProcessHTML) to ignore null click urls
    - improved the web view (SAWebView) to ignore urls like "about:blank"
    - refactored the "click" method of banner, interstitial & video ads to now contain the ad index (from the ad resoonse) and the destination. Now all methods more or less do the same thing and have the same structure. It's up to either the web view or the vast part to provide a valid click url, if it's available.
    - Improved the way the referral data is added to the click url. It's now part of the SACreative model (in the SAModelSpace library) as refferalData, and is properly populated in the SAAdParser library once all fields are present.
 - Refactored the CPI part in a separate library called SACPI (sa-mobile-lib-ios-cpi). 
    - Created a SAOnce class to make sure the CPI events are fired just once in the application's lifetime.
    - Created a SAInstall class that deals with sending the /install event to the ad server
    - SACPI is now a singleton
    - The library can be imported separately by advertisers if they just want to measure their installs, but don't want the full SDK
    - The library has now become a dependency of the main SDK. All previous CPI classes in the SDK have been removed
 - Improved the tag handling code to try to replace less characters in the tag so that more tags will work
 - Refactored the SAVideoPlayer class to be based on a Android Fragment and to simplify it.
    - the video player now better handles orientation changes
    - it also handles better when the activity changes (e.g. a browser window opens) and have eliminated a whole class of errors that might've happened because the underlying media player wasn't in a legal state
    - the SAVideoAd activity doesn't need to delete the video player when the ad ends (just so it can display the close button)
    - also in the main SAVideoAd activity the video player doesn't need to be played using a timer; it now emits an "Video_Prepared" event that indicates when the media should be played.
 - Reverted back the 15s close button change done in 5.4.2. Video ads have a hidden close button by default, that shows up at the end of the ad playing routine. It can be set to be visible from the start.
 - Changes to event handling:
    - Removed firing of all "impression" events for banner, interstitial & app wall ads (these are fired by the server). For video the "impression" event is still fired, but that's taken from the VAST tag, so it's OK.
    - Removed firing of all "install" events for ads
    - Removed firing of all "clickCounter" events for ads
    - Removed the VAST "custom_clicks" events alltogether
    - Renamed the "sourceBundle" query parameter to "bundle"
    - Renamed events with either "superawesome_viewable_impression" or "vast_creativeView", etc. 
 - Removed the method that determines whether to show a padlock or not. It's not controlled by an ad's "showPadlock" member 
 - Fixed a bug in the Unity & AIR plugins that meant that loading and then quickly closing a banner would have unintended consequences.

5.4.9
 - Banner ads don't fire up an "adClosed" event on first load
 - Fixed a bug with the Unity plugin that meant that "adFailedToLoad" events were sent back to Unity as "adFailedToShow" for video ads.
 - The video ad close button will appear by default after 15 seconds of content playing, meaning that disabling
the close button will have effect only for the first 15 seconds of play, or for ads shorter than 15 seconds. The close button will appear once the ad has ended nonetheless in that scenario.

5.4.8
 - Added a new SAImageUtils class in the SAUtils library. This helps create bitmaps and drawables from base colors, base64 encoded strings or files. It can also add round corners.
 - Refactored the video player library to be more simple and reliable. All drawables in this lib have been replaced by calles to SAImageUtils, so there are no dependencies, just code.
 - Refactored the main SDK banner, interstitial, video and app wall classes to have all their UI elements created in code and not dependent on xml layouts. This removes the need to add a layouts folder when you integrate the SDK as .jar files.
 - Refactored the main SDK banner, interstitial, video and app wall classes to have all their resources (drawables, pngs, etc) created by using the SAImageUtils class in the SAUtils library. This removes the need to add a res/drawables folder when you integrate the DSK as .jar files.
 - Refactored the main SDK video class to work with the new video player library.
 - Overall the SDK now does not depend on layouts or drawables to perform it's task and is more versatile when it comes to video playing. Also, when adding the SDK as a series of .jar dependencies, you don't have to worry about adding resoures, etc., just updating your manifest file.  

5.4.7
5.4.6
5.4.5
5.4.4
5.4.3
5.4.2
5.4.1
5.4.0
 - Refactored the SAWebPlayer class to load & display HTML content at a 1:1 ratio. Then that gets scaled using Matrix transforms to the desired width & height to fit a container properly. This means that ad scaling will not happen in HTML anymore, but in native code.
 - Refactored the SABannerAd & SAInterstitialAd classes to use the new web player and to not reload data on screen rotations, etc.
 - Improved SABannerAd to work with dynamically created fragments. This fixes a bug in which more than one banners displayed on the same activity would cause a crash.
 - Refactored the SABannerAd class to close an existing ad if a subsequent "load" method is called so as to reset the ad and keep a consistent visiual & internal state.
 - Refactored the SAWebPlayer click mechanism to be more simple and avoid a series of potential JavaScript issues. Now there are simply no briges between the underlining web view and native code.
 - Refactored the ad loader SAProcessHTML class to output simple encapsulating HTML for image, rich media and tag ads.
 - Added support for the adEnded event, fired when a video ad ends (but not necessarily closes)
 - Added support for the adAlreadyLoaded event, fired when an Insterstial, Video or AppWall tries to load ad data for an already existing placement
 - Added support for the clickCounterUrl; that's been added as part of the native Ad Creative model class and is now fired when a user clicks an ad.
 - Fixed a potentail NulLPointerException in SABannerad

5.3.13
 - Improved the SuperAwesome CPI to do the following:
 	- The CPI install event has to be triggered manually now by the SDK user (usually when the app starts). The CPI method now is accessible through the main SuperAwesome singleton interface and returns an async callback to the SDK user to indicate if the Ad Server recognized the install as valid or not.
	- The CPI install event now checks the user device against a list of possible app packages that the ad server sends to the SDK. If one of the packages sent by the ad server is also found on the user device, that information is passed down to the install event so that the Ad Server counts that install as being much more statistially significant.
 	- If the app using the SDK intercepts an INSTALL_REFERRER broadcast, it tries to parse that data and send a "custom.reffered_install" event to the ad server. These types of really direct installs (where the correlation is strict) will now be counted separately, so that advertisers will know they have N impressions/clicks, M statistical installs, out of which P are directly correlated installs.  
 - Made the Video ad close button appear at the end of the ad, if it's set to be invisible and the ad
 is set not to automatically close at the end. This removes an issue where if you disable both the close button and auto-close at end, the video would never be closed. This also improves the experience with regards to rewarded videos since now you can trigger your reward UI while still having the video in the background.
 - Refactored some of the SuperAwesome libraries that go in supporting the main SDK
        - SANetworking added a new class that downloads files from a list, sequentially
        - SAVASTParser was updated and now recursively parses VAST tags
        - SAAdLoader had the VAST & AppWall loading classes removed. Now it depends on SAVASTParser to figure out a VAST tag and the sequential file list downloader to get AppWall data
        - SAModelSpace added two classes needed for VAST parsing: SAVASTAd and SAVASTMedia
 	- Removed VAST elements from the SAAd model class, since now they're contained in SAVASTAd and SAVASTMedia. SAAd models are not associated with VAST and the VAST parser will not try to produce a SAAd model, but a SAVASTAd model.
	- Added methods to all enum definitions to initiate an enum value from an integer or string or vice-versa. This has taken the burden of getting correct enum values from JSON / Models to the enums, not the parsers.
        - SAEvents was simplified in relation to handling MOAT
        - SAUtils now has SAAlert and SALoadingScreen as classes (same for Android)
        - Small refactoring for the AIR, Unity & MoPub plugins
        - Renamed a lot of callbacks used by the SDK to include the "sa" particle at the start (so as not to have conflicts with other block definitions) and follow the "saDidDoThisOrThat" pattern.
        - Renamed a lot of enums to contain the "SA_" particle so as not to have conflicts with other
 C enum definitions.
 - Added, updated or improved tests for:
        - SANetworking
        - SAModelSpace
        - SAAdLoader
        - SAEvents
        - SAUtils
 - Added comments to each library and SDK file 

5.3.12
 - Minor change - update the SAAdLoader dependency to change the "bundle" parameter to "sourceBundle" to work with the actual ad server naming convention


5.3.11
 - Minor change - update the SAAdLoader dependency to add the "bundle" parameter to every click, impression, event; needed for CPI

5.3.10
 - Updated the AIR & Unity plugins to be more modular. That means that in both of them the code is not bundled any more into one big class or file, but split into multiple classes / files, such as SAAIRBannerAd, SAUnityVideoAd, etc. This not only spearates concerns but also makes it more manageable and easier to spot errors.
 - The AIR & Unity plugins can now override the main SDK version & sdk type. Meaning that when bundled as part of any of those SDKs, the Android SDK will report as "air_x.y.z." or "unity_x.y.z" instead of "android_x.y.z". This makes reporting so much more accurate. 


5.3.9
5.3.8
 - Made the Video ad close button invisible by default. Developers will now actively have to enable it in our SDK. In historical cases where this has been a problem it will mean an increased VCR rate.
 - Refactored the way the SDK works with default values. A default "SDK state" is now stored by the main SuperAwesome singleton. This dictates banner background color, default orientation, whether the close button is visible or not on video and all types of default values for everything that is customizable.
 - Refactored the AIR & Unity plugins to be more robust and do more error checking and to use default values in case any of the plugins don't somehow send values.
 - Refactored the MoPub plugin to be more robust and do more error checking.
 - Updated dependencies

5.3.7
 - Fixed another issue with SABannerAd and the background color - namely that at the start, unless calling mybanner.setColor(true/false) the banner background color would be the old color.

5.3.6
 - Updated SABannerAd and SAInterstitialAd background colors to 224, 224, 224 

5.3.5
 - Added generic setters for each of the properties needed to configure loading & playing for banners, interstitials, videos and app wall
 - Banners:
   - load parameters: test mode, configuration (production or staging)
   - play parameters: parental gate, background color
 - Interstitials:
   - load parameters: test mode, configuration (production or staging)
   - play parameters: parental gate, orientation (any, portrait, landscape)
 - Videos:
   - load parameters: test mode, configuration (production or staging)
   - play parameters: parental gate, orientation (any, portrait, landscape), close button, auto close, small click button
 - App Wall:
   - load parameters: test mode, configuration (production or staging)
   - play parameters: parental gate

5.1.0
- Added SAAppWall as a new ad format that's supported by the SDK

5.0.0
 - Base version 5
 - Added new publisher interface for SABannerAd, SAInterstitialAd, SAVideoAd
 - In this new version each type of ad is responsbile for loading & playing the ad unit
 - Also, onse an ad has been played, it has to be loaded again
